# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
HR Analytics Case Study - Logistic Regression Model

# About the DataSet

Problem Statement:
A large company named XYZ employs approximately 4,000 people at any given time.
However, each year, approximately 15% of its employees leave the company and must be replaced with the available talent pool
in the labor market. Management believes that this level of attrition
(employees leaving, either on their own or because they were fired) is bad for the company, for the following reasons:

1 - Ex-employees' projects are delayed, making it difficult to meet deadlines, resulting in a loss of reputation among consumers and partners;

2 - A sizeable department needs to be maintained, in order to recruit new talent;

3 - Most of the time, new employees need to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatize to the company.

Therefore, management hired an HR analytics firm
to figure out what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition.
In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace in order to convince
most of their employees to stay.
They also want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed immediately.

# Case Study Objective

It is necessary to model the probability of attrition using logistic regression.
The results obtained will help management understand what changes they should make
to their workplace in order to convince most of their employees to stay.
